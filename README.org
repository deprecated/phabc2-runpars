* Description

A collection of Fortran namelist i/o files, which contain the parameters for different runs of the radiation-MHD code Phab-CÂ²

** Directory structure
#+begin_example
  RUNSET/in/RUN.pars
#+end_example
Where =RUNSET= is =pdrturb=, =pdrkrum=, etc. 

** How to clone this repo into an existing directory tree

In my standard set-up, this directory structure is rooted in the directory =FOO/Fabio/C2Ray/runs/=, which also contains directories =RUNSET/out/=, which is where all the output datacubes go. Since the =runs/= directory already has things in it, we cannot do a =git clone git://github.com/deprecated/phabc2-runpars.git= into it. However, all is not lost since we can do the following:
#+begin_src sh
  git init
  git remote add origin git://github.com/deprecated/phabc2-runpars.git
  git fetch # automaticlly creates * [new branch]      master     -> origin/master
  git add pdrturb/in/*.pars # adjust according to circumstance - must add all pre-existing files
  git checkout master
#+end_src 



* Active run sets

** pdrturb

HII region in uniform magnetized medium. 

*** Ostar-et
O star in turbulent medium, with entropy fix (=e=) and temperature ceiling (=t=), currently set at 3e4 K. 


** pdrkrum

HII region in turbulent, magnetized, molecular cloud

* Old run sets
